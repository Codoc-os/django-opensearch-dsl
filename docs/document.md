Documents Classes
================

## `Django` subclass

The `Django` subclass contains parameters related to Django's side of the document :

* `model` (*required*) - Model that will be used for the indexing.
* `fields` (*optional*) - List model's field name that should be indexed. Do not add the fields you manually declare
  into this list. See [Document Field Reference](fields.md) for how to manually define fields.
* `queryset_pagination` (*optional*) - Size of the chunk when indexing,
  override [`OPENSEARCH_DSL_QUERYSET_PAGINATION`](settings.md#opensearch_dsl_queryset_pagination).
* `ignore_signals` (*optional*) - If set to `True`, this Document will be ignored by the [auto-syncing](#autosync)
  feature. Default to `False`.
* `related_models` (*optional*) - List of related Django models. Any change made to models in this list will trigger a
  re-indexation of the related instances of the model associated with this Document. See [auto-syncing](#autosync) for
  more information.
* `auto_refresh` (*optional*) - Whether to refresh the affected shards after performing the indexing operations. Default
  is `False`. `True` makes the changes show up in search results immediately, but hurts cluster performance.
  `"wait_for"` waits for a refresh. Requests take longer to return, but cluster performance doesnâ€™t suffer. This
  per-Document setting overrides [OPENSEARCH_DSL_AUTO_REFRESH](settings.md#opensearch_dsl_auto_refresh).


```python
class Country(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    area = models.BigIntegerField()
    population = models.BigIntegerField()
    continent = models.ForeignKey(Continent, models.CASCADE, related_name="countries")


@registry.register_document
class CountryDocument(Document):
    class Django:
        model = Country
        queryset_pagination = 128
        fields = ['name', 'area', 'population']
        related_models = []
        ignore_signals = True
        auto_refresh = True

    id = fields.LongField()
    continent = fields.ObjectField(properties={
        'id': fields.LongField(),
        'name': fields.KeywordField(),
    })
```

These parameters can be access through the `django` attribute of `Document`'s instance (
e.g `CountryDocument().django.model`)

## `Index` subclass

This subclass contains parameters about Opensearch :

* `name` (*required*) - Name of the index.
* `auto_refresh` (*required*) - Perform an index refresh after every update if `True` (
  overrides [`OPENSEARCH_DSL_AUTO_REFRESH`](settings.md#opensearch_dsl_auto_refresh))
* `settings` (*optional*) - Settings of the index, will be merged
  with [`OPENSEARCH_DSL_INDEX_SETTINGS`](settings.md#opensearch_dsl_index_settings) (settings define here prevail over
  the ones defined in `OPENSEARCH_DSL_INDEX_SETTINGS`).

  For a list of settings,
  see [Opensearch's index settings](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/index-apis/create-index/#index-settings).

## `Meta` subclass

Any attributes on the `Meta` class that are instance of `opensearchpy.MetaField` will be used to control the mapping of
the meta fields (`_all`, `dynamic`, etc).  
Just name the parameter (without the leading underscore) as the field you wish to map and pass any parameters to the
`MetaField` class:

```python
@registry.register_document
class CountryDocument(Document):
    class Django:
        ...
    
    class Meta:
        dynamic = MetaField('strict')
    
    ...
```

If you do not plan to use the dynamic mapping feature of OpenSearch, it is **highly recommended** to set the `dynamic`
meta fields to `strict`. This can prevent future problem if you need to modify the mapping later (see 
[Updating an existing index](document.md#updating-an-existing-index) for more information).



## Manually defined fields

In addition to `Document.Django.fields`, you can manually define any number of fields. For more information about
fields, see the [Document Field Reference](fields.md).

## Indexing data

The data to index is obtained through 3 methods :

* `get_queryset()` which return the base queryset.
* `get_indexing_queryset()` which divide the queryset into manageable chunk for Opensearch.
* `should_index_object()` Which individually filter out objects that should not be indexed.

By subclassing one or more of these methods, you can choose which objects you want to index, as well as optimize the
queryset used to fetch the data.

---

* `def get_queryset(self, filter_=None, exclude=None, count=None)`

    * `filter_` (`Optional[Q]`) - `Q` object given to the queryset's `filter()` method.
    * `exclude` (`Optional[Q]`) - `Q` object given to the queryset's `exclude()` method.
    * `count` (`Optional[int]`) - Limit the queryset with the given number.

By default, this method retrieves all objects from the model associated with the `Document`, optionally filtering and
excluding elements according to the given arguments. You can also limit the number of results using the `count` argument.

You can inherit this method to modify the queryset, this can be useful if you need to select or prefetch related models
to make the indexing faster, or to create an annotation to use as a field.

Example:

```python
@registry.register_document
class EventDocument(Document):
    class Index:
        name = 'event'

    class Django:
        model = Event

    country = fields.ObjectField(doc_class=CountryDocument)

    def get_queryset(self, filter_: Optional[Q] = None, exclude: Optional[Q] = None, count: int = 0) -> QuerySet:
        """Select country to improve indexing performance."""
        return super().get_queryset(filter_=filter_, exclude=exclude, count=count).select_related('country')
```

---

* `def get_indexing_queryset(self, filter_=None, exclude=None, count=None, verbose=False, action=OpensearchAction.INDEX, stdout=sys.stdout)`

    * `filter_` (`Optional[Q]`) - Given to `get_queryset()`.
    * `exclude` (`Optional[Q]`) - Given to `get_queryset()`.
    * `count` (`Optional[int]`) - Given to `get_queryset()`.
    * `verbose` (`bool`) - If set to `True`, will display the progression of the action on standard output.
    * `action` (`OpensearchAction`) - Used by the verbose.
    * `stdout` (`io.FileIO`) - Standard output used when verbose is `True` (default to `stdout`).

This method chunks manually the queryset before sending them to Opensearch while displaying the progression and time
remaining on stdout.

You can override this method to change the method of chunking (default implementation create a generator by chunking
manually the queryset into smaller queryset), or the way the verbose is handled.

Example:

```python
@registry.register_document
class EventDocument(Document):
    class Index:
        name = 'event'

    class Django:
        model = Event

    def get_indexing_queryset(self):
        """Use iterator to chunk the queryset, discarding any verbose."""
        qs = self.get_queryset()
        return qs.iterator()
```

* `def should_index_object(self, obj)`

    * `obj` (`Model`) - Object about to be indexed

This method is called for every object in the queryset. Return `False` if the object should not be indexed.


## Document ID

The Opensearch document id (`_id`) is not strictly speaking a field, as it is not part of the document itself. The
default behavior of `django_opensearch_dsl` is to use the primary key of the model as the document's id (`pk` or `id`).
Nevertheless, it can sometimes be useful to change this default behavior. For this, one can redefine
the `generate_id(cls, instance)` class method of the `Document` class.

For example, to use an article's slug as the Opensearch `_id` instead of the article's integer id, one could use:

```python
# models.py

class Article(models.Model):
    # ... #

    slug = models.SlugField(
        max_length=255,
        unique=True,
    )

    # ... #
```

```python
# documents.py

class ArticleDocument(Document):
    class Django:
        model = Article

    # ... #

    @classmethod
    def generate_id(cls, article):
        return article.slug
```

## Updating an existing index

***/!\ Caution:*** Once the OpenSearch index has been created, modifying the `Document` class will not update the
OpenSearch index mappings, **but any new field will be sent when indexing new document**.  
This can lead to some problems since dynamic mapping is enabled by default and these new fields will be dynamically
mapped with probably the wrong type.

To apply changes done to your `Document` class to an existing OpenSearch index, you must call the
[`manage.py opensearch index update <index>`](management.md#index-subcommand) command.


## Autosync

This package provide an auto-syncing feature. It will automatically update the index when a model is
created / saved / deleted.

You can also update the index of related models by defining [`Document.Django.related_models`](document.md#django-subclass)
and the method `get_instances_from_related(self, related)`. This method take an instance of a related model and
should return the instances corresponding to the Document. For example, if you have a `Country` model with a `Continent`
and multiple `City`, you can define the following Document:

```python
class ContinentInnerDocument(InnerDoc):
    id = fields.LongField()
    name = fields.KeywordField()
    code = fields.KeywordField()

class CityInnerDocument(InnerDoc):
    id = fields.LongField()
    name = fields.KeywordField()
    postal_cod = fields.KeywordField()

@registry.register_document
class CountryDocument(Document):
    class Django:
        model = Country
        fields = ['name', 'area', 'population']
        related_models = [Continent, City]

    id = fields.LongField()
    continent = fields.ObjectField(doc_class=ContinentInnerDocument)
    cities = fields.NestedField(doc_class=CityInnerDocument)
    
    def get_instances_from_related(self, related: Continent | City) -> List[Country]:
        if isinstance(related, Continent):
            return related.countries.all()
        return [related.country]  # isinstance(related, City)
```


Since this feature uses Django's signals, it has the same limitation and this feature only works
when the  `save()` or `delete()` methods of your models are called. It does not work with most
bulk operation such as `queryset.bulk_create()`, `queryset.update()`, `queryset.delete()`...

It is important to note that the autosync feature can have a significant impact on performance, especially used in
conjunction with related models.
